# Olt
If you're like me and read a lot of articles but want to read them without the noise, then this is the extension for you. Just the words and the images, nothing else, exactly as you want them.

Say NO! to...
* Stupid ads
* Terrible fonts
* Weird pops ups
* Errant nav menus

Say YES to:
* Words
* Images

*Go from this:*

<img src="src/img/readme/noisy.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>


*To this:*

<img src="src/img/readme/action-shot-1.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

### Installation

### Extension Lore 
The name *Olt*, comes from the Irish 'alt' (pronounced like 'olt' to the anglophone) which means article.
